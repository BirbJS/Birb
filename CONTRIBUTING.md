# Contributing to Birb.JS
We're open to outside contributors! But, to keep things from decending into chaos, we have some rules we need to go over.

## Coding style
Everyone has their own coding style. However, this can become an issue when opening source code to contributions. As a general rule of thumb, you should try match the repository's coding style as much as possible. We ask that you take a few minutes to read over some of the files to get a sense of this.

## Dependencies
As a general rule of thumb, you should ensure any dependencies you add are licensed openly. *Personally*, I don't see the GPL and AGPL licenses as open-source promoting licenses, so dependencies that use these should be avoided. This is one of the main reasons I stayed well away from licensing this project under any GNU license, and instead opted for Mozilla's very permissive license that ensures developers can use Birb.JS without bottlenecks.

## Discussions
If you see something in a pull request that makes you go, "wait, what?", challenge it! We want to keep Birb.JS as community focused as possible. If you disagree with the way something's been done, **respectfully** talk about it in that pull request, preferably using comments on the line of code that's the issue.

## Trusted contributors
Once you've contributed enough, you may be added as a trust contributor. This allows you to make decisions on whether or not to allow a pull request to be merged on to the main branch, along with 2 other users (or a repository admin).
