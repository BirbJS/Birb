## About
Birb.JS is a simple, yet powerful [Discord API](https://discord.dev) wrapper for [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org).    
With just a few lines of code, you can get a Discord bot connected to the API.    
**Birb.JS is still in development. It is highly recommended you DO NOT use it until itâ€™s ready.**

### Optional Addons
Birb.JS comes with a few optional addons made by our team.    
Please view their documentation for more information on how to use them.

- [@birbjs/framework](https://birb.js.org/addons/framework) is a framework to make the development of Discord bots easier and more efficient. It includes an in-built command handler, permission system, event manager and built-in slash command support (`npm install @birbjs/framework`)
- [@birbjs/sharding](https://birb.js.org/addons/sharding) is a sharding utility that makes it easier to shard your Discord bot (`npm install @birbjs/sharding`)
- [@birbjs/cluster](https://birb.js.org/addons/cluster) is a clustering utility that is built for larger Discord bots who need to split shards across multiple seperate servers (`npm install @birbjs/cluster`)
- [@birbjs/devtools](https://birb.js.org/addons/devtools) is a debugging tool for Birb.js developers, contributors and maintainers. (`npm install @birbjs/devtools --save-dev`)

### Optional Dependencies
These dependencies aren't required, but will allow Birb.JS to do things more efficiently. **NPM may attempt to install these by default.** To force NPM to not attempt to install these, add the `--no-optional` command line argument.

- [erlpack](https://npmjs.com/package/erlpack) for faster (de)serialization of websocket data (`npm install erlpack`)
- [zlib-sync](https://npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for websocket compression (`npm install zlib-sync`)
- [bufferutil](https://npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for quicker (un)masking of websocket data and packets (`npm install bufferutil`)
- [utf-8-validate](https://npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) for more efficient websocket data validation (`npm install utf-8-validate`)
- [@discordjs/opus](https://npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/opus) for voice support - e.g. talking in voice channels (`npm install @discordjs/opus`)

**Most of these dependencies require [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) which some users may struggle to install (mostly due to very unhelpful errors).**

If you're on Windows, run `npm install windows-build-tools --global` in an **administrator** command prompt.    
If you're on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install build-tools`.    

*Remember that these are optional dependencies. If you're struggling, feel free to ignore them. Birb.JS will only use them if they are available.*

## Example
```js
const { Client, Intents } = require('birb');
const client = new Client({
    intents: [ 'DIRECT_MESSAGES', 'GUILDS', 'GUILD_MEMBERS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES' ],
});

client.listen('ready', () => {
    console.log('Connected to Discord!');
});

client.connect('your-bot-token');
```
